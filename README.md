# The Discourse of Asynchronous Online Discussions

## Introduction

With the continued rise in popularity of online courses, examining the nature of how learners in those courses interact is crucial to understanding the knowledge construction process in those courses. This project will attempt to begin to articulate the big "D" Discourse associated with participation in asynchronous discussions in fully online higher education courses. In this case, Discourses are defined as the "ways of behaving, interacting, valuing, thinking, believing, speaking and, often, reading and writing" (Gee, 2015, p.4). In order to analyze the Discourse of asynchronous discussions, I have analyzed data from the learning management system at a large university in the southeastern United States. The dataset spans eight semesters (Spring 2013 - Summer 2015), and contains 225,691 discussion posts from across 7,581 topics. This research will address the following questions:

1. How are asynchronous discussions used in fully online courses?
2. What are the characteristics of academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?
3. Who participates in academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?
4. To what extent do people participate in academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?
5. What specific behaviors do we see across Discourse in academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?

This project is meant to be foundational towards my larger research agenda into learner-to-learner interaction, which will include research on asynchronous discussion board use in fully online courses. I intend for my work on this progress to evolve into a paper to be put forth for publication, but such a paper was too large in scope for my work this semester.

## About the Dataset

### Ethical/Privacy Concerns

The mechanisms I am using to gather the data for this project are somewhat new to higher education and largely unexplored at the university where the research is being conducted. As such, there are not existing protocols for the exact situation of this research within the context of this research. In working with IRB, the following factors were taken into account:

1. The research being done here does not involve an intervention. It is simply the collection of existing data.
2. No additional action is being asked of anyone for the purpose of this research. Therefore, this is considered not human subjects research.
3. It is possible to encrypt the identification information of the individuals whose data is being used for this research. Therefore, it is possible to examine the behavior of individuals within and across courses without knowing who the individual is.

These factors were important for gaining IRB approval to conduct this research. Because the research is considered "Not Human Subjects" research and the identification of the individuals whose data is being used is being obfuscated from the researcher by way of encryption, the research was able to move forward without gaining the explicit consent of every individual whose data was collected. The requirement to gain such consent would have rendered the research effectively impossible, as there are 6,339 unique individuals whose data is represented in this dataset. Being required to collect explicit consent from that many distributed individuals, some of whom are likely no longer active at the institution where the research is being conducted, would have made this research infeasible.

With the level of access to data required to conduct this analysis, the researcher must take the ethics of this research very seriously. First, the discussion posts made in online courses should be considered sacred. That is, those posts are written in a community of learners, and those communities should be seen as safe spaces where students are free to express themselves and collaborate on their learning journies. These are not open communities where anyone can come in and read these conversations as a lurker. As such, this research will not reproduce the exact posts of any individual. I believe there is a time and place for such items to be republished for examination, but within the scope of the research currently undertaken it would be a line too far to replicate content written in a private space verbatim for the purpose of this research. Therefore, this research will examine general behaviors and trends of people who participate in ansynchronous online discussions for the purpose of understanding the Discourse that happens in those spaces, but I will not expose the writing of any of the 6,339 individuals whose data was gathered for this analysis.

### Technologies Used in Working with the Dataset

In order to gather this data, the researcher used the application programming interface (API) for the learning management system (LMS) that is used at the institution where the research was conducted. The data was gathered using the Python programming language, and it was stored in the MongoDB database system. The data analysis for this project was conducted using the Python programming language and Google Sheets. The researcher will make all of the Python scripts used to analyze this data available as an appendix.
