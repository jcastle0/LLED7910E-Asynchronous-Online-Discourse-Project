# The Discourse of Asynchronous Online Discussions

## Introduction

With the continued rise in popularity of online courses, examining the nature of how learners in those courses interact is crucial to understanding the knowledge construction process in those courses. This project will attempt to begin to articulate the big "D" Discourse associated with participation in asynchronous discussions in fully online higher education courses. In this case, Discourses are defined as the "ways of behaving, interacting, valuing, thinking, believing, speaking and, often, reading and writing" (Gee, 2015, p.4). In order to analyze the Discourse of asynchronous discussions, I have analyzed data from the learning management system at a large university in the southeastern United States. The dataset spans eight semesters (Spring 2013 - Summer 2015), and contains 225,691 discussion posts from across 7,581 topics. This research will address the following questions:

1. How are asynchronous discussions used in fully online courses?
2. What are the characteristics of academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?
3. Who participates in academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?
4. To what extent do people participate in academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?
5. What specific behaviors do we see across Discourse in academic asynchronous discussions in fully online courses?

This project is meant to be foundational towards my larger research agenda into leaner-to-learner interaction, which will include research on asynchronous discussion board use in fully online courses. I intend for my work on this progress to evolve into a paper to be put forth for publication, but such a paper was too large in scope for my work this semester.
